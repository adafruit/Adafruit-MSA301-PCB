### Description

The MSA301 is a super small and low cost **triple-axis accelerometer**. It's inexpensive, but has just about every 'extra' you'd want in an accelerometer:

* Three axis sensing, 14-bit resolution
* ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g selectable scaling
* I2C interface on fixed I2C address 0x26
* Interrupt output
* Multiple data rate options 1 Hz to 500 Hz
* As low as 2uA current draw in low power mode (just the chip itself, not including any supporting circuitry)
* Tap, Double-tap, orientation & freefall detection
To make life easier so you can focus on your important work, we've taken the MSA301 and put it onto a breakout PCB along with support circuitry to let you use this little wonder with 3.3V (Feather/Raspberry Pi) or 5V (Arduino/ Metro328) logic levels. Additionally since it speaks I2C you can easily connect it up with two wires (plus power and ground!).  We've even included [SparkFun qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) compatible [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) connectors for the I2C bus so **you don't even need to solder!** Just wire up to your favorite micro and you can use our [CircuitPython/Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MSA301) or [Arduino drivers](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MSA301] to easily interface with the MSA301 and get motion measurements ASAP.
